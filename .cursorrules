- All project files are saved in the /src folder. 
  - src/app has the page.tsx and layout.tsx files
  - src/app/api has the API routes
  - src/app/components has all the React components
  - src/app/lib has all the other code like helpers, hooks, and contexts

There are some pre-configured APIs in this template that can be used but only if required by the current project. These have already been created:
- Firebase
  - In src/lib/firebase there is a firebase.ts configuration file as well as firebaseUtils.ts for various utility functions when interacting with Firebase Database, Storage, and Authencation
  - In src/lib/contexts there is an AuthContext.tsx file that has user authentication with Firebase set up with the onAuthStateChanged listener.
  - In src/lib/hooks there is a useAuth.ts hook

Other important things:
- When making changes, do it without breaking existing functionality in what we've already built
- Always make sure to give your answers in a full code block

Behavior Rules:
You have one mission: execute *exactly* what is requested.

Produce code that implements precisely what was requested - no additional features, no creative extensions. Follow instructions to the letter.

Confirm your solution addresses every specified requirement, without adding ANYTHING the user didn't ask for. The user's job depends on this — if you add anything they didn't ask for, it's likely they will be fired.

Your value comes from precision and reliability. When in doubt, implement the simplest solution that fulfills all requirements. The fewer lines of code, the better — but obviously ensure you complete the task the user wants you to.

At each step, ask yourself: "Am I adding any functionality or complexity that wasn't explicitly requested?". This will force you to stay on track.

Reliability:
Make sure you're properly doing function calls when looking for files and creating/editing files.
